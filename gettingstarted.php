        <h2>Thrifting</h2>
        <p>Thrifting is one of my favorite ways to find clothing. Every visit to
          thrift store is an adventure because you don't know what you'll find. This can sometimes be a bad thing but usually you're bound to find something you like. I recommend Goodwill and Salvation Army. Thrifting is inexpensive and the best way to get great deals on clothing. Plus, it's environmentally friendly because you're reusing clothing that would have gone to waste. Thrifting is best for people with a vintage style of clothing. Also, don't be afraid to venture into the clothing section of the opposite gender. The men's section has many oversized sweaters and t-shirts and often has a better selection than the women's section! </p>

        <h2>Urban Outfitters</h2>
        <p>You probably have already heard of Urban Outfitters, but it deserves a mention. Urban supplies pretty much every style of trending clothing. Plus, its clothing is high quality -- unlike fast fashion stores. I highly recommend heading straight to the sale section if you are looking for their affordable clothing. Be wary, though, their sale section has the stuff that less people wanted to buy, so you aren't exactly getting the cream of the crop. Urban Oufitters offers a lot of vintage-style clothing and also name brands like Adidas. </p>

        <h2>Online Thrifting</h2>
        <p>So, I get it. Thrift stores aren't that easy to find. Also, weirdly, a lot of them are expensive, especially in big cities like New York City. Plus, if you're used to online shopping, thrifting seems like a burden. Lastly, some people might not be willing to take the risk of going thrifting when there's a chance they won't find anything they like. If that sounds like you, then I HIGHLY recommend installing apps like Depop and Poshmark! Personally, I prefer Depop because it's easier to navigate and find clothing that suits your specific style. You can choose between styles like vintage and hypebeast. Also, a lot of thrift stores actually sell their stuff on DePop! Just a disclaimer -- when you factor in shipping costs you probably will end up spending more on DePop than if thrifting in person. However, there are a lot of deals offered by sellers on DePop, like free shipping if you buy 2 or more items. Make sure to take advantage of those deals and be aware of them! </p>

        <h2>Zara</h2>
        <p>Zara is pretty popular with middle-aged women, but it has a great selection for young adults, too. Zara definitely is not vintage and most of their clothing will give you a classy and mature look. I would describe most of their clothing as either minimalist or avant-garde, depending on which section you look at. In my experience, unlike Urban Outfitters, the quality of their clothing isn't up to par with their prices. I strongly suggest just buying stuff from their sale section or finding used Zara items at thrift stores and online. Unlike the other stores I've mentioned, Zara also offers clothing that is business-appropriate and professional, if you want to be stylish in the office. </p>

        <h2>TJMaxx, Marshalls, Ross, Macy's Backstage</h2>
        <p>These stores are often associated with middle aged women instead of trendy clothing. Admittedly, they don't have the best options for teens, but for young adults, they have a great selection with thrift-store prices. Although the items are supposed to be leftovers and damaged items, they usually aren't damaged in my experience, or at least not a noticeable amount. You can even find high-end clothing at a reasonable price at these stores! I really like these stores because they give a shopping experience similar to thrifting. You need to sort through a bunch of clothes to find the needle in the haystack. Some people might find this burdensome, but it's pretty exciting when you find something you really like for a great price! </p>

        <h2>Brandy Melville</h2>
        <p>Brandy Melville is known to most of us as an old trend that was popular in middle school and most of high school. It's pretty problematic with its "one size fits all" policy. I honestly don't support Brandy Melville as a brand and don't like what they stand for. However, if you just want some trendy clothing and happen to be on the petite or slim side, it is a safe bet. Their clothing is pretty basic, with a lot of solid colored clothing and graphic tees. I would say this store is great for people that don't want to put too much effort into their style and aren't looking to take any risks or make any statements. </p>

        <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
        <p>On the other hand, fast fashion is not environmentally friendly and isn't usually ethical, unfortunately. Plus, you get what you pay for. Pretty poor quality clothing. Examples of fast fashion stores include H&M, Forever21, and online stores like Fashionnova, Romwe, and Shein. Thrifting and stores like TJMaxx is definitely the best option when it comes to getting ethically-sourced and high-quality clothing at a good price, but these fast fashion stores provide trendy clothing at a low price. Also, they are much more accessible than decent thrift stores, for the most part. You can order fast fashion online easily and stores like H&M are at most malls. You also don't have to search as much as you do at thrift stores. Pretty much all clothing at fast-fashion stores are "in style" and palatable for most people. Although not the best options available, these stores provide a wide selection of stylish clothing at a low price. </p>

        <h2>American Eagle</h2>
        <p>I personally think American Eagle is underrated. I wouldn't say it's the most trendy and I don't like a lot of their styles. However, their sales are pretty affordable and their clothing is better quality than Brandy Melville. Oftentimes, their quality is on par with Zara. I highly recommend trying their jeans when they have a sale going on. I've found that their jeans fit me well and aren't as unforgiving as the fit of most Abercrombie and Fitch jeans. </p>
