* The header has the title of the web page in order to give the user a sense
  of what the website is about and where they are located within the website.
* The navigation bar is on every page so the user knows what else is on the
  website and gives them a way of clicking between pages easily.
* The images of clothing are arranged in a neat grid to make them easy to look
  through and not overwhelming.
* The footer at the bottom of the page gives credit to the web developer.

![Image of About Page](about.JPG)
* The about page includes the navigation bar and a header which lets the user
  know where they are within the website and gives them a means of getting to
  other pages.
* The text describing what the website is about is centered to show that it is
  main component of the web page. The text is also padded so the page does not
  look crowded.

  clothing, which gives the user a sense of the confidence someone can have
  if they express themselves through fashion.
* The footer at the bottom of the page gives credit to the web developer.

  and gives them a way of getting to other web pages.

  look crowded.

  user discern the questions from the answers.
* The footer at the bottom of the page gives credit to the web developer.

![Image of Style Inspiration Page](inspiration.JPG)
* The navigation bar and header show the user where they are on the website,
  where they can go, and gives them a way of getting to other pages.
* The images are arranged into a grid so the user is not overwhelmed by
  so many images. Because of the organization of the photos, the page still
  looks neat and presentable.

  inspiration on how to dress.
* The footer at the bottom of the page gives credit to the web developer.

## Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?
I plan on having a control asking the user what they look for in clothing to see
what values users have when shopping, whether it be affordability, style, comfort, or convenience.
I also ask about where the user is planning on finding clothes in the future to see if they will take the advice described on the website. I also ask if they have a better sense of their style after visiting the website. Lastly, I ask for any additional feedback from the visitor.

> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.
I will thank the user for providing feedback. Then, I will echo their responses to each of the questions as well as the questions themselves so the users remember what the form said. This way, they can be sure that their responses were received.



> How does this form meet the needs of at least one of your target audiences (specify which)?
These elements of the form ask for input from both people who are on a budget and people who are only concerned about fashion. Through this form, I can see how well I addressed both of these audiences' needs and how to improve my website to cater to them. I can also see, based on the users' values, which stores they decided to shop at. If their values match with the stores I recommended for their needs (on the Getting Started page), then I know they took my advice and was useful to them.

### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write out your pseudocode plan for handling the validation of the form.

```
show_first_error_message = FALSE
show_second_error_message = FALSE

show_form = TRUE

is_valid = TRUE

if POST request sent {
  get value of post request from each input
  check if value of each request is empty:
    if empty, then show feedback above that specific input. Also, set is_valid to FALSE.

set show_form to the opposite of is_valid

}
```

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Target Audiences (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the target audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable by both target audiences.
My final site meets the needs of both people on a budget and people whose only concern is finding fashionable and trendy clothing. I did this by creating a "Getting Started" page that has a list of ways to find clothing that is of good value, and a list of stores that have the trendiest clothing with the most variety. In my descriptions, I explained the pros and cons of each platform or store that I recommended, making sure to think from the target audience member's perspective. I also provided a list of links to websites and apps that I mentioned such as Poshmark and DePop. I decided to provide links for these websites because they are lesser known than brands like Brandy Melville and Urban Outfitters. I also centered the links and used bold colors to draw the reader's attention to the links. The content I wrote was all in black lettering against a white background to make it easy to read. Through the getting started button on the home page, I made it easy for users to find this useful content. The about page also thoroughly describes the purpose of the website and how to get the most out of it. This makes the website easy to use for anyone. Lastly, the inspiration page I provided appeals to both target audiences because it simply shows inspiration for styles they might want to buy. Therefore, the visitor can use this inspiration when buying any clothing, whether it be affordable or high-end.

### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?
I didn't take 1300 but I had previous web development experience before starting this assignment. Through this assignment, I learned a lot about making design choices that make the website user-friendly and meet the needs of different audiences. I was able to consider the audiences that most likely would use my website and designed my website accordingly. When creating this website, I learned to not make design choices purely for aesthetics, but also with a purpose.
