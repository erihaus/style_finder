      <td id="text">My name is Erika Hauschild and I got into fashion pretty recently.
        I'm not claiming that my style is perfect, but I definitely have a sense of what my style is. I find most of my clothing by thrifting. I would describe my style or "aesthetic" as a mix of vintage and what I think of as classy. Zara is one of my favorite brands, and I thrift a lot of their clothing as well as buy their clothing on sale. <br><br> I created this website to help you find your style(s), too! Keep in mind that all of your clothing doesn't have to fit one, specific style. However, it's still worth exploring different styles to see which ones you like best! <br><br> Look at the <a href="inspiration.php">Inspiration Page</a> to find out what stores to shop at based on what catches your eye.
        Look at the <a href="gettingstarted.php">Getting Started Page</a> to learn about stores, websites, and apps that can help you find affordable and trendy clothing!<br><br>
        Use this site to find the clothes that make you feel most
        confident and attractive.
        Learn about your aesthetic and discover your eye for fashion.
